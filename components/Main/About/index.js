              I&apos;ve always enjoyed creating stuff, and clearly remember all the drawings, I
              think one of them was a mickey mouse one. And at the age of thirteen I got my first
              computer and I remember it could do anything, and of course I had to play all the cool
              games.

                  But quickly realized I enjoyed the development aspect of games, and jumped to
                  developing plugins, extensions and addons for popular games like Minecraft, GTA V
                  and Counterstrike. A few months later Discord became a thing and just a year after
                  Discords initial release I joined and discovered robots. And the kid I was didnâ€™t
                  expect the mind-blowing experience of interacting with an API on that scale.

                  A few years later I started doing game design and 3d in the more popular program
                  ZBrush, and realized the visual aspects of development was the thing for me. And
                  that&apos;s where my passion for Web dev started. During Corona I started an
                  education in front-end, and I can only say that has been one of my best decisions
                  ever. Meeting so many clever people was overwhelming but at the same time just
                  what I needed, and I knew this was it.
