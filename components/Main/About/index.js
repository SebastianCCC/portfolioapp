            I've always enjoyed creating stuff, and clearly remember all the drawings, I think one
            of them was a mickey mouse one. And at the age of thirteen I got my first computer and I
            remember it could do anything, and of course I had to play all the cool games.

                  transition={{
                    delay: 0.2,

                  But quickly realized I enjoyed the development aspect of games, and jumped to
                  developing plugins, extensions and addons for popular games like Minecraft, GTA V
                  and Counterstrike. A few months later Discord became a thing and just a year after
                  Discords initial release I joined and discovered robots. And the kid I was didnâ€™t
                  expect the mind-blowing experience of interacting with an API on that scale.

                  A few years later I started doing game design and 3d in the more popular program
                  ZBrush, and realized the visual aspects of development was the thing for me. And
                  that's where my passion for Web dev started. During Corona I started an education
                  in front-end, and I can only say that has been one of my best decisions ever.
                  Meeting so many clever people was overwhelming but at the same time just what I
                  needed, and I knew this was it.
